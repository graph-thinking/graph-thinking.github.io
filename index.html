There are no isolated pieces of information in this connected world, but rich and connected domains all around us. Graph Database embraces relationships as a core aspect of its data model to store, process, and query connections efficiently.

Understanding the connections between data, and deriving meaning from these links, doesn’t necessarily mean gathering new data. Significant insightscan be drawn from one’s existing data, simply by reframing the problem and looking at it in a new way: as a Graph.

From a metaphysic perspective we all belong to an [Universal Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_graph).
